# MesEnView System Design
**(under active development & deployment)**

## Description
**The technological invention and innovative design strategies of the MesEnView system focus on advancing imaging techniques in the bio-medical field and incorporate several state-of-the-art imaging principles and mathematical formulation with machine learning network topologies, including light-field microscopy, lens-less imaging, coded aperture imaging, integral imaging, microlens array (MLA) computer-aided design (CAD), optical system light-field ray tracing simulation, digital refocusing algorithm with Fourier slice theorem, inverse reconstruction algorithmic formulation with machine learning network topologies solution, spatially-varying point-spread function (PSF) optimization, and monolithic microfabrication 3-D printing technologies. These key elements collectively contribute to the system's sophisticated imaging capabilities and innovative design solutions.**
